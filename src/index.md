# A responsive, progressively enhanced burger menu

Burger menus are a relic of responsive design that no matter what your opinion of them is, they continue to be a dominant design pattern. Theyâ€™re very good at preserving often-limited horizontal space, but they also, more often than not, are built in a user-hostile, non-accessible fashion.

[In this premium tutorial](https://piccalil.li/premium/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu), weâ€™re going to build a burger menu from the ground up, using progressive enhancement, `ResizeObserver`, `Proxy` state and of course, super-solid HTML and CSS that pull from the CUBE CSS principles.

This whole page is what youâ€™re building in the tutorial ðŸ‘†. [Letâ€™s dive in](https://piccalil.li/premium/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu)
